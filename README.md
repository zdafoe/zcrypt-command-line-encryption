# zcrypt-command-line-encryption
This is a project i have been working on for command line encryption
Zcrypt versions 1 and 2 are completely portable python scripts. Version 1 the least secure and very slow. 
Version 2 is much more secure and much faster than version 1 but still very slow.
Version 3 uses the exact same algorithm for encryption as version 2 but uses C++ for all of the time consuming parts which makes it much faster.
So far i've only gotten version 3 to work on windows when i tried compiling the C++ code for linux on my virtual machine it didn't work and i haven't had time to make it work yet.
But all of the c++ and python should be compatible with any system as i did not use any system specific code.
